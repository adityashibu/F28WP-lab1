## Image Gallery

### Which Version of the Image Gallery did I go for?

I went for the image slider instead of the image carousel as I found it more challenging to code and because it seemed to integrate better with the theme of the website

### Challenges I faced

1. Image Sizes were different

2. Troubleshooting the JavaScript file to make it work as expected

3. Getting the anchor tags to work as expected to make sure they switched images as the user clicked on them

### How I overcame these challenges

1. I downloaded images of the same resolution, and the ones that still didn't fit, I resized those images on canva and imported them back

2. I took references from various resources to troubleshoot and get my JavaScript working, most of it being from OpenAI and Stackoverflow which helped me understand what was going wrong with my code, most of it being related to the names I had defined

3. I used the document.getelementbyid and stored the anchor tags in a variable to then define what would happen when the user clicks on the anchor tags, namely to change the image that is displayed.
